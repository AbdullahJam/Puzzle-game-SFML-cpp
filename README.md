# Designing a puzzle game using the C++ programming language

This project aims to learn how to use the SFML library and how to create interfaces for two-dimensional games using the c++ programming language.
The game has been developed to a large extent, you can notice the animation when the balls collide with each other, and also when some balls fall, you can notice the falling animation.

The game is designed smoothly so that you can modify the settings from the temeller.h file in terms of the length and width of the window, the number of balls in each row, the number of colors, the speed of the game, and the speed of the arrow movement
